# Question
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

 

Example 1:
    
    Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
    Output: true
    Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
     To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

    Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
    Output: false
    Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
     To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
     also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

# Solution
本题在于检测是否存在环路，以-1，0，1表示未遍历，存在环路，遍历完成，然后根据状态码来判断情况，代码如下：
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>(numCourses);
        Integer[] vertices = new Integer[numCourses];
        Arrays.fill(vertices, -1); //unvisited
        //initialize a neighbour graph
        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) graph.add(i, new ArrayList<>());
        //construct the neighbour graph
        for(int[] prerequisite: prerequisites) graph.get(prerequisite[1]).add(prerequisite[0]);
        //traverse the neighbour graph
        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if(vertices[i] != -1) 
                continue;
            if(!finishPrerequisite(vertices, graph, i))
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    public boolean finishPrerequisite(Integer[] vertices, List<List<Integer>> graph, int i) {
        if(vertices[i] == 1) return true; // already visited backtrack
        if(vertices[i] == 0) return false; // found loop backtrack
        vertices[i] = 0;
        //this vertice does not have any vertice
        if(graph.get(i).size() == 0) {
            vertices[i] = 1;
            return true;
        }
        //the loop
        for(int childIndex = 0; childIndex < 
            graph.get(i).size(); childIndex++) {
           if(!finishPrerequisite(vertices, graph, graph.get(i).get(childIndex)))
               return false;
        }        
        vertices[i] = 1; // mark it as visted
        return true;
    }
}
```
