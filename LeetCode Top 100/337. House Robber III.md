# Question
The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

       3
      / \
     2   3
      \   \ 
       3   1

Output: 7 
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
Example 2:

Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]

        3
       / \
      4   5
     / \   \ 
    1   3   1


# Solution
普通递归法：
```java
public class Solution {
    public int rob(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null)
            return 0;
        int rootVal = root.val;
        int leftHand = 0,rightHand = 0;
        if(root.left != null){
            int l1 = rob(root.left.left);
            int l2 = rob(root.left.right);
            rootVal += l1+l2;
            leftHand = rob(root.left);
        }
        if(root.right != null){
            int r1 = rob(root.right.left);
            int r2 = rob(root.right.right);
            rootVal += r1+r2;
            rightHand = rob(root.right);
        }
        if(leftHand + rightHand > rootVal)
            return leftHand + rightHand;
        return rootVal;
    }
}
```
